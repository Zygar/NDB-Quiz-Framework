Liniments are generally oil-based or alcohol-based solutions. They usually contain medicines with analgesic, soothing, rubefacient, or stimulating properties.

Most liniments are intended to treat muscle or joint pain, either by their local soothing action or stimulating the blood flow in the area they have been applied to. This stimulation is known as the counterirritant effect.
