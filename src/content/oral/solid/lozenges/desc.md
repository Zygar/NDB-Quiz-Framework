Lozenges are hard, sugar-based medicated confections designed to be slowly dissolved in the mouth. Lozenges can be like a boiled sweet, or powdery and compressed.

Pastilles are also medicated confections, but have a softer base.

Lozenges and pastilles are usually medicated with antiseptics, aromatic oils and local anaesthetics intended to produce a local effect on the membranes of the mouth and throat (buccal membranes).
