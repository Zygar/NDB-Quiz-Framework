**Ampoules** are small glass or plastic tubes that have a drawn out sealed end. The top can be snapped, twisted, or rocked off.

**Vials for reconstitution** are sealed glass vials containing a medicine in sterile powder form. A sterile solvent is added aseptically before use.

**Multidose vials** are usually small bottles with a rubber cap held on by a metal ring. The injection needle is forced through the rubber cap to withdraw the required dose. A bactericide will be present to keep the vials sterile (unless the medicine itself is sufficiently bactericidal).
