Bulk granules are labelled 'Take (DOSE) in water x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

The dose should be expressed in a quantity that the person can readily measure, preferably in terms of 5 ml spoonfuls (approximately equal to 5 g).

Some granules are presented in foil sachets that contain a standard dose. They should be labelled 'Take the contents of (DOSE) sachet, in half a glass of water (or specific ml amount) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.
