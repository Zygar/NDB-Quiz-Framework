The dose is usually measured by 5 ml spoonful and may be taken by:

-   placing small quantities dry on to the tongue and swallowing with water, but without chewing -- many bulk-forming laxatives are taken this way
-   first stirring into a glass of fluid -- many granules disperse easily when added to fluid, and effervescent preparations are meant to be taken this way.
