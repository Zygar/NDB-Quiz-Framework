Injections should be labeled with clear instructions on the dose, route and frequency of administration.

If the dose needs to be reconstituted first this can be added with "Reconstitute with xxml of water for injection and then inject xxx (as above)

Labels for injections may also require labeling statements (or auxillary stickers) that guide the client on appropriate storage requirments and on expiry. Â Expiry is limited once a product is reconstituted or once a multi dose vial is in use. The client will need clear advice on storage and expiry before use and once in use.
