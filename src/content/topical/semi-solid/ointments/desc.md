An ointment is a preparation with a fatty, waxy, or synthetic base -- for example, soft paraffin. Ointments are not necessarily greasy, although many are.

Ointments are used where the skin needs to be softened or protected from water or irritant chemicals. By forming a film on the skin they reduce moisture loss, protect the skin from air, and hold medicines on the skin for a long time.
