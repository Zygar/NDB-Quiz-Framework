Like metered-dose inhalers, breath-activated inhalers are intended to deliver medicines to the mucosa of the respiratory tract for a local action only.

These inhalers don't contain a propellant. Instead the person uses their natural breathing force to deliver the medicine to its site of action. The medicine is supplied in a reservoir device that releases a measured dose each time.

To dilute and improve its flow properties, the finely powdered medicine is often mixed with larger particles of a non-active powder such as lactose. When the person inhales the larger particles of inert powder impact on the walls of the throat and upper airways, but the fine medicine particles travel down to the narrower airways of the lungs.

Breath-activated inhalers have grown in popularity. They are simpler to use than aerosols, because they don't require the same level of coordination. However, clients need to be able to breathe in with enough force to activate these inhalers.
