Lotions include:

-   thick suspensions like calamine lotion (not recommended for use now, but still available)
-   oily emulsions like oily calamine lotion (not readily available)
-   clear solutions containing alcohol for quick drying.

Some lotions are suspensions of powder in water. After application the water evaporates rapidly, with a cooling effect, and the powder film is left on the skin.

Lotions have a lower viscosity (are not as thick) as creams and ointments, which makes them easier to apply thinly to larger areas. They tend to dry the skin. Lotions with an aqueous vehicle should have an expiry date, because they are prone to microbial contamination.
