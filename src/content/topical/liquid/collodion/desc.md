A collodion is a solution that forms a flexible cellulose film on the skin when it dries.

Collodions may be used as a protective film over abrasions when they usually contain antiseptics and analgesics. They may also be used to treat warts and corns when suitable substances such as salicylic acid are incorporated.

Collodions are usually ordered in very small quantities and must be dispensed in bottles with airtight closures to prevent the solvent, usually ether, from evaporating. These containers must be absolutely dry to prevent cloudiness.
