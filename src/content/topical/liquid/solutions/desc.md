A topical preparation described as a solution or liquid is usually an aqueous solution of a medicine.

Aqueous solutions are prone to microbial contamination, so they should contain an expiry date. For example, normal saline is often prepared in single vial plastic units.

Some preparations may be alcohol based. Topical preparations in alcoholic solutions are called spirits or tinctures. After application they dry quickly, leaving a film on the skin.
