Elixirs should be labelled with 'Take x ml (DOSE) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'. Their high alcohol content will require an 'Avoid Alcohol' CAL. They may require a 'Shake the bottle' label.

They need no special labelling unless mixed or diluted on dispensing. In these cases they should be labelled with 'Shake the bottle' and an expiry detail. Your pharmacist will guide you as to what expiry applies.
