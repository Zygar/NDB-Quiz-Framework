Eye drops are sterile liquids for instilling into the conjunctival sac of the eye. They contain medicines dissolved or suspended in aqueous or oily vehicles intended to treat medical conditions in the eye.

Tears are continually being produced and will quickly wash away the medicine. For this reason eye drops often have to be instilled frequently, often every 4 hours.

Eye drops are designed to have a local action, although there have been reports of medicines getting into the systemic system via the naso-lacrimal ducts.
