Mixtures consist of one or more medicines that have been dissolved or suspended, usually in an aqueous vehicle, but occasionally in a suitable non-aqueous vehicle.

Mixtures may be clear solutions, suspensions, or emulsions.

Mixtures are meant to be taken orally for absorption from the GI mucosa, mainly to produce systemic effects. Some antacid or antidiarrhoeal mixtures are used for their local action on the stomach and bowel.
