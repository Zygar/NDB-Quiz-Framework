An aerosol inhaler consists of a solution or suspension of a medicine in a non-active propellant that is held under pressure in an aerosol dispenser.

When the aerosol is activated, the propellant forces the medicine from the container into the mouth to be inhaled into the lungs.

The container is fitted with a special metering valve so that when activated the aerosol always delivers the same dose.
