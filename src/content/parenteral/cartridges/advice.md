Advise clients that insulin cartridges that are not being used should be stored in the refrigerator at 2°C--8°C, away from the cooling element (do not freeze). Cartridges that are loaded into the pen injector should not be kept in the fridge. These can be stored at room temperature for several weeks, but must be protected from excessive heat or light.

Some cartridges may need to be shaken or rolled before administration.

Clients should be advised on how to dispose of vials or cartridges and needles after use.

A diabetes nurse will usually teach clients how to administer the insulin. You can point clients to manufacturer-specific videos online for more information.
