Most capsules are designed to be taken intact and are labelled 'Take (DOSE) xxxx times daily (FREQUENCY).

Controlled release and enteric coated capsules should be labeled with "Take (DOSE) swallowed whole xxxx times daily (FREQUENCY)'

Some special capsules have been produced that Â require opening to release controlled release beads. The capsule is opened and the contents sprinkled onto soft food and swallowed without chewing. This gives a controlled release effect without the difficulty of having to swallow large tablets or capsules whole. These should be labelled 'Sprinkle the contents of (DOSE) on soft food and swallow without chewing'.
