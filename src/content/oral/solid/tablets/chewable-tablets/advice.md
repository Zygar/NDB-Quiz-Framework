Remind clients that chewing is an important part of the administration process. If they don't chew the tablet, the medicine might not work. Follow the tablet with a glass of water.

Chewing gums containing nicotine are an exception to the 'chew then swallow' instruction. They are designed to release their medication from a specially constructed matrix when bitten. The nicotine is then absorbed through the buccal mucosa. The pharmacist should instruct the person on the correct use of these preparations, because overchewing will lead to overdosage.
