A linctus is a thick, syrupy solution containing medicines to treat coughs and often aromatic substances to soothe the throat.

Linctuses are taken orally in small doses (usually 5--10 ml) to produce a systemic effect. They are sometimes added to an equal volume of warm water, which helps to release the aromatics. Because the preparation is thick and syrupy, it also has a local, soothing action on the mucous membranes of the throat.
