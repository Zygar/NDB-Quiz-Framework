Always make sure the person knows how to use their pessary (they are not for oral use) and realises the pessary must be removed from its plastic or foil packaging before insertion.

You can talk through how to insert the pessary:

-   wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
-   remove any foil or plastic wrapping from the pessary and applicator (if supplied)
-   sit or lie down wth your knees bent and legs apart
-   insert the pessary gently high into the vagina
-   if using an applicator, depress the plunger to release the pessary
-   remove the applicator
-   throw away used materials and wash your hands thoroughly.
