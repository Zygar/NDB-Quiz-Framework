Chewable tablets are designed to be chewed so they reach the stomach in a disintegrated state. Sometimes the tablets are meant to have local action and the finely divided medicine mixes rapidly with the stomach contents (for example, antacids). In other cases a systemic action is required. This speeds up the absorption of the medicine because of its finely divided state.

The few tablets made to be chewed are flavoured.
