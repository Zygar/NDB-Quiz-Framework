Nasal drops and sprays are labelled with 'Use (or sometimes instil for nose drops) x drops (or puffs/sprays) (DOSE) into each nostril x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

Nasal drops and sprays are exempt from requiring 'Not to be taken'.

Nasal drops and sprays will need to have an expiry after date of opening included on the label and some will need a 'Shake well before use' statement.

Decongestant nasal preparations are used for short-term relief and may be labelled 'Do not use for more than 5 days', depending on the doctor's preferred directions. Other nasal sprays may be more suitable for long-term use -- for example, corticosteroid nasal sprays.
