Nasal drops and sprays are liquid preparations for instilling into the nostrils. They may be aqueous or oily solutions and usually contain medicines with antiseptic, analgesic, decongestant, or anti-inflammatory properties. A nasal spray containing nicotine is also available to aid in smoking cessation. This is formulated so the nicotine is absorbed systemically.

To be effective drops and sprays must be used correctly.

Xylometazoline nasal spray is an example of a decongestant nasal spray that is ready-to-use. Its ingredients are volatile at room temperature.
