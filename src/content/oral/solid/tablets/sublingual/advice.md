Clients should be reminded that these tablets don't work properly when they are swallowed â€” they need to be placed under the tongue for the medicine to be absorbed. These tablets should be protected from moisture and prolonged exposure to light. Clients may also require specific instruction on how to remove the tablet from the blister pack (for example, pull the foil back from where the seal is lifted).

As with all medicines, keep out of reach of children.
