Injections should be labelled with clear instructions on the dose, route and frequency of administration.

Labels will begin with 'Inject x (the dose in mg, grams or units) intravenously (or Intramuscularly or subcutaneously) every x hours (or weekly, daily, three times daily)'.

If the dose needs to be reconstituted first, this can be added with 'Reconstitute with x ml of water for injection and then inject x' (as above).

Labels for injections may also require labelling statements (or auxillary stickers) that guide the client on appropriate storage requirments and expiry. Expiry is limited once a product is reconstituted or once a multi-dose vial is in use. The client will need clear advice on storage and expiry before use and once in use.
