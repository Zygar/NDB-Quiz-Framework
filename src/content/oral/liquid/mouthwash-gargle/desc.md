These are special solutions that are designed to act locally. They are classed as external medicines, which means they should not be swallowed. Mouthwashes and gargles are usually concentrated solutions that are diluted before use. They usually contain antiseptic and analgesic medicines for treating mild infections, and are intended to have a local effect on the mucous membranes and help freshen the breath.
