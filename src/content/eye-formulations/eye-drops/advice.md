When an eye drop is instilled it may:

-   run out of the eye and be lost
-   be diluted by tears and lose its effect
-   run down the naso-lacrimas duct and throat into the stomach to give systemic side effects.

For these reasons it's important to instil eye preparations correctly. The conjunctival sac can only hold a small amount of fluid, so it's important that the client waits 5 minutes between drops if more than one drop is needed. Remember that the tip of the applicator should never touch the eye.

Pressure applied to each side of the bridge of the nose will prevent systemic side effects from the more potent drops.

The solution may be warmed to body temperature prior to each application by holding the bottle in the hands.
