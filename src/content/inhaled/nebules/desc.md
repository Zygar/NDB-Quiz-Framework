Nebulisers are generally recommended for people with respiratory disorders that can't be well controlled by other means. They help by:

-   supplying a fairly large dose of medicine
-   producing a fine mist of medicine that penetrates the lungs better.

Nebules (also known as respules) are solutions of medicines. These solutions can be converted into inhalations via a nebuliser. Nebulisers are used to deliver higher doses of medicine to the airways than is possible using standard inhalers. Nebulisers are also suitable for people who can't correctly use inhalers -- for example, the elderly or infants.
