Tablets contain medicine and other additives that are compressed to form suitable shapes.

Substances other than the active medicine may be added to the formulation. These are known as excipients and are used:

- as fillers to make the tablet a manageable size
- to flavour or colour them to make them easier to take
- to modify the release and absorption of the medicine -- these include binders, gliders, disintegrants and lubricants.

When the tablet is made, the medicine is mixed together with any additives and converted into free-flowing granules. The granules are fed into highly-polished cavities called dies and compressed by punches that bind the granules together. The size of the dies and the pressure applied determine the size and hardness of the tablet.

The tablets must undergo standard tests to ensure that the tablet:

- weight and content is correct
- is not too hard or soft
- will break up and dissolve as it is meant to.

Tablets may be:

1.  uncoated
2.  sublingual
3.  buccal
4.  oral dispersable and wafers
5.  chewable
6.  effervescent or soluble
7.  coated
8.  controlled release.
