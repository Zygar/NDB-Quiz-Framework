These are solid dose units that are applied to the skin. They are designed to have a completely systemic effect. The medicine is absorbed through the skin to enter the systemic circulation. Forms used include patches.

These systems give a constant dose over a long period, and they avoid the problems associated with oral doses, such as gastric side effects and metabolism of the medicine before it reaches the systemic circulation.
