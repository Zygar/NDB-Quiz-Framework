The advantages of sprays for oral use include that they:

-   are easy for the person to carry with them and use when necessary
-   can be applied directly to the site of action -- for example, throat sprays for local pain relief
-   provide quick symptom relief
-   can be quickly absorbed into the systemic system and bypass any biotransformation by the liver.

The disadvantages of sprays for oral use include that:

-   the dosage may not be consistent
-   they may cause local irritation
-   the person may not understand where to spray the medication.

Containers should be strong enough to resist damage or piercing, and have a suitable pump action to provide doses of medicine.
