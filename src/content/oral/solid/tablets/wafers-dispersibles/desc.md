Oral dispersibles and wafers are designed to disintegrate rapidly on the tongue. They are useful for clients who can't easily swallow tablets, or if compliance is an issue.

In some products absorption is buccal, but others are simply swallowed once they have disintegrated, and absorption will occur lower in the gut.
