You should advise clients about how to store ampoules/vials before use. For example, ampoules/vials may need to be kept it in a cool, dry place, out of reach of children, protected from light, or in the fridge.

You will also need to inform clients about how to prepare the dose before administration -- for example, shaking the ampoule or reconstituting the dose -- and how to administer it if they are doing it themselves.

You can also give instructions regarding the disposal of ampoules/vials, as well as the syringes or needles used to administer the dose. A sharps container may be offered if required.
