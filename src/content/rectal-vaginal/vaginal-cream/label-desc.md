Vaginal creams and gels should be labelled with 'Insert the contents of x applicator(s) (DOSE) into the vagina x times daily (FREQUENCY)'. Some may only be used once or twice each week.

It is a legal requirement for 'CAUTION: NOT TO BE TAKEN' or 'FOR VAGINAL USE ONLY' to be included on the label.

Remember that most products for vaginal use are to treat an infection locally in the vagina. Therefore these products should be labelled with C & A Reference D -- that is, complete the whole course of treatment (whether it be 3, 7, or 10 nights).
