Buccal tablets are placed between the upper gum and cheek and produce a systemic effect. The released medicine is absorbed through the mucosa of the buccal cavity. This has the same advantages as sublingual absorption, although onset will be slower.

Buccal tablets are unsuitable for irritant or unpleasant tasting medicines.
