Sublingual tablets are dissolved under the tongue. The skin under the tongue is easily penetrated, so sublingual medicines are rapidly absorbed. The medicine is absorbed through the oral mucosa (lining of the mouth) to give rapid systemic effects.

Once absorbed the medicine is distributed throughout the body and does not pass through the liver. This is useful for medicines that are largely destroyed by the liver's metabolism.

Irritant or unpleasant tasting medicines can't be given this way.
