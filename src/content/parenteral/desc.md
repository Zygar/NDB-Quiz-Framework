Parenteral dose forms are injected.

Injections are sterile solutions, suspensions, or emulsions that contain one or more medicines in an aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle.

Injections are often used to give medicines that can't be given orally because of their instability, poor oral absorption, or because the person may be vomiting or unconscious. In an emergency an injection can provide a rapid and effective response.

Common injection sites include intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous.

Injections may be designed to give prolonged effects, either systemically or locally. These are often called depot injections.

### Vehicles

A vehicle is the substance the active medicine is mixed into. If a vial contains a medicine that's in powder form, a suitable product for reconstituting will need to be provided too. Water or saline are used most often . These come in sterile forms that are suitable for use by injection.

Sterilised vegetable oils such as arachis, sesame, cottonseed and maize can be used as solvents. These vehicles give a prolonged acting injection that when injected into the muscle tissue is only slowly absorbed.

### Packaging

Most injections will be supplied in their original pack. When you have to pack or repack ampoules or vials, always use a container that adequately protects them from being crushed or broken. Use tissue, bubble wrap, cotton wool, or other packing to prevent the injection being damaged in the containers.

When packing infusion bags, take care they will not get punctured.
