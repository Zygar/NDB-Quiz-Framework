Gels are water-based medicated preparations that include a gelling agent such as gelatine or another cellulose derivative.

Gels are prepared from substances that absorb water. They are suitable for use on hairy areas, because they are easily removed with water. Examples are Lamisil Dermgel and miconazole oral gel.
