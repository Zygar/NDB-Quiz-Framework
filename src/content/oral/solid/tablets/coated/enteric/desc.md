Enteric-coated tablets have a coating that modifies the disintegration of the tablet and is insoluble in the acid of the stomach, but soluble in the alkaline conditions found in the intestine. These coatings are intended to release their medicine in the intestine and be absorbed through the intestinal lining for a systemic effect, or for a local effect on the intestine itself. To have the desired effect the enteric coating must remain intact until the correct site is reached.

Enteric coatings are used when:

-   the medicine might cause stomach irritation
-   the medicine might be destroyed in the stomach
-   some delay in release of the medicine is required
-   a repeat action effect is required (only the inner core is enteric-coated in this case).
