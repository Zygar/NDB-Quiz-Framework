Shampoos are labelled with 'CAUTION: NOT TO BE TAKEN' and 'Use x ml (DOSE) as a shampoo x times weekly (FREQUENCY)'.

Some shampoos must stay in the hair for some time before being rinsed out (for example, products for treating head lice). These should be labelled 'Massage (QUANTITY) into the hair and leave (TIME REQUIRED) before rinsing'.
