Film-coated tablets have a coating made from a type of soluble plastic substance to mask unpleasant flavours. The coat is shiny and transparent, and dissolves quickly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, meaning disintegration of the tablet is not delayed. Film-coated tablets are taken orally and generally intended to be absorbed from the GI mucosa (the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, including stomach and intestines) for a systemic effect.

If a coloured tablet is required, the tablet must be coloured before the coat is added.
