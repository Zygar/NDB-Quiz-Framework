Uncoated tablets are intended to break up readily when swallowed and release the medicine. They are usually used for medicines required to produce a systemic effect, because their rapid break up helps the medicine to dissolve and be absorbed.

Uncoated tablets usually have rather a dull finish and may be somewhat powdery. They may be marked with trade or identification marks, and may be scored to help people break them.
