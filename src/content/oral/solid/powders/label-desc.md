Bulk powders -- for example, nutritional formulas such as Fortisip -- would be dispensed in their original container and labelled 'Take (DOSE) in x mL of water, x times daily (FREQUENCY)'. The dose should be expressed in a quantity that the person can readily measure, preferably in terms of 5 ml (approximately 5 g) spoonfuls.

Some powders are presented in foil sachets that contain a standard dose. They should be labelled 'Take the contents of (DOSE) sachet, in half a glass of water'. An example is Ural Effervescent Powder.
