The label instructions will depend on the product. You must include dose, frequency and instructions for when to remove the patch. Some patches are changed daily, while others might only be applied once a week.

For example, label instructions for a patch that is changed daily may read 'Apply x patch (DOSE) to clean, dry non-hairy skin once daily (FREQUENCY). Remove the patch after x hours. Alter application site with each new patch'.
