Controlled or modified release tablets modify the release of medicines so that a therapeutic blood level can be maintained with fewer doses. The medicine can be released at the wrong time if the tablet is damaged -- for example, by breaking or chewing -- so these tablets should be labelled 'Take (DOSE) swallowed whole', or 'Swallow (DOSE) whole'.

The main types of controlled release formulations are:

-   sustained release or prolonged action
-   repeat action
-   delayed release.

There are three different types of modified release tablets. Their names may be followed by SR, CR, or XR.
