To prepare inhalations, a small amount of the volatile substance -- for example, 5 ml of Menthol and Eucalyptus Inhalation or one teaspoonful of Vicks Vaporub -- is added to hot (not boiling) water. The vapour produced is inhaled for 5--10 minutes. Boiling water should not be used to prepare inhalations, as this may cause scalding or too much of the volatile ingredient may vaporise at once.
