These medicines should be labelled 'Shake the bottle', followed by specific instructions for administration. For example, 'Take x mL (DOSE) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

These medicines deteriorate rapidly after the water has been added and should be used only for the time specified on the labels. Label with the appropriate expiry date. They may require storage in the fridge. Clearly indicate this on the label.
