Clients should be reminded that lozenges and pastilles generally work locally in the mouth, so swallowing them produces very little/no effect.

Some lozenges, such as antifungal treatments, are designed to be rolled around in the mouth so that the medicine covers more of the buccal membranes. Other lozenges, such as local anaesthetics, should be held in one place so that they only make the throat numb. Make sure you give the appropriate advice to your client, depending on the medicine they've been prescribed.
