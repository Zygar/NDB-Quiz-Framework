Clients must learn how to administer the injection â€” for example, by pushing air out of the syringe, inserting the needle at a 45 degree angle in a dart-like motion, and making sure the injection hasn't entered a blood vessel.

Advise clients on the safe disposal of syringes and needles. A sharps container may be offered if required.
