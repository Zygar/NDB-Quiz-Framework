The label must clearly state the dose and frequency. For example, 'Take x mL (DOSE) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'. Add a 'Shake the bottle' auxillary label or the equivalent on the main label. For example, 'Shake well and take/give x mL x times daily'.

Suspensions may also require auxillary labels for storage and expiry details. For example, an antibiotic suspension must be stored in the fridge and discarded 1--2 weeks after reconstitution.
