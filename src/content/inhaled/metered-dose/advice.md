Explain to the client that shaking a metered-dose inhaler ensures the medicine is evenly distributed in the propellant.

Each puff delivers a measured dose by filling a small chamber at each operation. For accurate dosage time must be allowed between puffs for this chamber to fill. When more than one puff is prescribed as a dose, tell the person to wait 1â€“5 minutes between puffs.

Aerosol inhalers must be kept clean. The device that holds the metered-dose aerosol canister can be washed in warm, soapy water, rinsed and dried thoroughly.

The major reason for therapeutic failure of aerosol treatments is faulty administration technique, particularly in the very young and the elderly. People may be using their medication regularly, but if their technique is poor they will not get the full benefits of their treatment.

It's important to check that people know how to use their inhalers and regularly check their technique by asking them to demonstrate usage, or reminding them of the correct technique.

A number of aids, such as spacer devices and haleraids, are now available to help clients use their aerosols. These aids overcome the difficulty some people have with coordinating breathing in at the same time as activating the inhaler to release the dose of medicine.
