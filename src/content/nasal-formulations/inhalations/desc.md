These are liquid preparations containing volatile ingredients. Volatile substances are those that change easily from a solid or liquid to a gas or vapour. When vaporised -- that is, changed into a gas -- the substances come in contact with the mucous membranes of the nasal and upper respiratory tract for local effect. They are used to relieve congestion due to coughs and cold, or to hydrate very dry upper respiratory passages.

Examples of nasal inhalations (vapour) include Menthol and Eucalyptus Inhalation or Vicks Vaporub (which can be made into an inhalation).

Steam vaporisers are also a form of inhalation. These are machines that will vaporise liquids suitable for inhalation.
