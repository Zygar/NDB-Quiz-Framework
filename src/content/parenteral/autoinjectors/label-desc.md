The label must clearly state the dose, route and frequency of administration. For example, 'Inject the contents of ONE syringe ONCE a FORTNIGHT as directed'.

A label for prefilled pens or auto-injectors might read 'Administer ONE dose subcutaneously via auto-injector as directed at first signs of symptoms. Repeat after x hours if needed. Do not use more than x doses in 24 hours'.

Pre-filled insulin pens can be labelled in the same way as a box of insulin cartridges, clearly stating dose and frequency. A statement reminding clients about pen priming might also be included on the label, as well as storage and expiry details
