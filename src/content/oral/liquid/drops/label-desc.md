Oral drops should be labelled 'Shake the bottle'. Give dosage instructions in the number of drops or the volume to be taken, as measured by the dropper supplied with the medicine, and the frequency of dose. For example, 'Place 1 ml (DOSE) in mouth x times a day (FREQUENCY)'.

When a local action is also desired, as with antifungal preparations, after stating the dose the label should say 'To be held in the mouth then swallowed'.

#### Paediatric drops

Use the verb 'give' rather than 'take' when labelling paediatric drops formulated for children.
