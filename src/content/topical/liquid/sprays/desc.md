Sprays and aerosols contain medicines for topical use under pressure. They depend on the power of liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container.

After spraying on to the skin, the propellant rapidly evaporates, leaving a thin film of medicine on the skin. These differ from the inhaled dose formulations in that they don't provide a metered dose. They work like household aerosols and will spray while the nozzle is depressed.
