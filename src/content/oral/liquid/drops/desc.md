Drops may be a solution or suspension of a potent medicine to be given in a dose specified in drops or a very small volume. This is measured with a calibrated dropper. Drops are usually supplied in their original packs, because the manufacturer has designed the dropper bottle or calibrated dropper to deliver the correct dose.

Drops may be intended for either a local action on the oral mucosa and/or systemic action after absorption from the GI mucosa.
