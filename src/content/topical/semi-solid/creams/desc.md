A cream is a viscous emulsion and may contain medicines or be used for its soothing and moisturising properties.

Creams are the most widely used dermatological preparations. They are useful in inflammatory conditions and may be used on weeping areas and hairy areas. They are simple to apply and easily removed by washing. Creams are not suitable for chronic scaling skin diseases where a protective effect is required.

Creams that are oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions -- for example, hydrocortisone cream -- tend to be non-greasy. They are sometimes called aqueous creams. They tend to allow the medication to make more intimate contact with the skin, particularly when the skin is wet with serum, as in weeping eczema.
