Some drugs, such as insulin, are available in cartridges that need to be loaded into the manufacturer-specific 'pen' injector before use. A needle must be attached to the insulin cartridge in the pen prior to administration.

With insulin pens, clients can dial doses up or down in small increments to fine tune their insulin therapy.
