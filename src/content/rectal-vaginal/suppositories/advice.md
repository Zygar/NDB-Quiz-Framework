Always make sure the person knows how to use their suppositories and to remove any plastic or foil packaging before insertion.

You can talk through how to insert the suppository:

-   wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
-   remove all the foil wrapper from the suppository
-   lie on your side and raise your knee to your chest
-   inset the suppository gently and slowly, pointed end first, into the rectum
-   throw away used materials and wash your hands thoroughly.
