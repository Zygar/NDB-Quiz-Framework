It's important to check clients' technique. Some clients, particularly frail older adults, may have a better outcome using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer.

The technique for using a dry powder inhaler varies depending on the device that is prescribed. For a turbuhaler:

-   Turn the grip as far as it will go and then back again to load a dose.
-   Breathe out and then insert the mouthpiece.
-   Seal lips firmly around the device and breathe in steadily.
-   Remove the device from mouth and then breathe out gently through the nose.

The delivery apparatus and the powdered medicine must be kept dry. Warn the person not to exhale through the apparatus, because this will make the powder 'cake' and an effective dose will not be delivered. These devices should not be shaken.
