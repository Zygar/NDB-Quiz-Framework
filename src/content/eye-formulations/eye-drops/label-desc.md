Eye drops should be labelled 'NOT TO BE TAKEN. Instil (or place) x drops (DOSE) in eye(s) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

Add CAL 7 or 7A, with an appropriate expiry for the product once it has been opened. For most eye drops this is 30 days after opening the container.

Some eye drops — for example, eye drop suspension — will also require a 'Shake before use' labelling statement.
