When labeling an oral spray most pharmacies will use instructions similar to 'Spray x puffs (DOSE) on to the affected area x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

Some products may need extra labelling statements to cover expiry details.

Some products need shaking prior to use. This should also be added to the instructions on the label.
