A simple breath-activated device will be labelled with 'Inhale x dose (DOSE) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

If the inhaler needs a dose to be loaded into the device first, this can be added to the label instruction. For example, 'Remove dose from foil and load into device, then inhale the contents (DOSE) x times daily (FREQUENCY)'.

Warnings such as 'Do not breathe out through device' or 'Keep device dry' can also be added to labels.

Some products require an expiry detail to be added, as the stability of the products can be limited once blisters have been opened.
