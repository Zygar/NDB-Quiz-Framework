Some medicines are unstable in liquid form, so they may be manufactured as dry powders with flavourings, sugars and wetting agents in suitable bottles. When required, a predetermined quantity of water is added to the bottle to make a syrup or suspension. An example of a medicine in this form is amoxicillin syrup 125 mg/5 ml.
