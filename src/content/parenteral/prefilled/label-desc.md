The label must clearly state the dose, route and frequency of administration. For example, 'Inject 1 ml (100 mg) subcutaneously once daily as directed'.

Sometimes part of the dose will need to be discarded before administration. In this instance the label might look something like 'Discard 0.1 mL (10 mg) and then inject 0.9ml (90 mg) subcutaneously once daily'.
