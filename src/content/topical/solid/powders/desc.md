Powders are mainly used as a base for antifungal and antibacterial medicines. They are rarely used these days, but help to keep an area dry and are useful in areas prone to sweating.

Antifungal powders are used to mop up moisture in socks and shoes, but are never to be applied to broken or weeping skin. Fine powders can provide lubrication between opposing dry skin surfaces, preventing irritation caused by friction.
