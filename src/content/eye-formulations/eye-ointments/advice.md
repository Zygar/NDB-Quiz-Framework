Eye ointments can blur the vision when they are first used, but this should last for only a few minutes. The tip of the applicator should never touch the eye.

Go through the application instructions with the client:

1. remove cap from tube
2. gently pull lower eyelid down
3. carefully squeeze a small strip of ointment along the lower portion of the eye
4. slowly close the eye without blinking
5. keep eye closed for 1--2 minutes.
